# psh - Python Shell (POSIX Compliant Implementation)

For this project, I developed a POSIX-compliant shell capable of interpreting and executing shell commands. The shell supports both external programs and built-in commands such as cd, pwd, echo, and more. Throughout this project, I gained expertise in shell command parsing, Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) design, and the implementation of built-in commands.

## Key Features:
- Command Parsing: Handles various shell commands and arguments.
- REPL Implementation: Continuously reads and executes user inputs.
- Built-in Commands: Includes cd, pwd, echo, and type.

## Usage:
Run the psh script to start the shell. Use commands like `echo`, `pwd`, `cd`, and `type`.

## Future Enhancements:
- Command History: Navigate through previously entered commands.
- Advanced Parsing: Support for piping and redirection.
- Custom Prompt: Customizable shell prompt.
- Configuration File: User-specific settings and startup commands.
